	Growing up n the household that I did, I grew up watching sports everyday and playing them day in and day out. 
	At a young age, roughly around 4 or 5 years old, I'd began to get into sports like Basketball, Soccer, and Football. 
	I played all three sports leading up to middle when I started to become more serious about my aspirations in football. 
	I began to better myself as a football player so that I could live out my dream of playing college football and later playing in the NFL. 
	As a freshman in high school, I moved to the state of New Jersey where I attended Don Bosco Prep School in Ramsey, NJ. 
	After my time there, I felt that I needed to return home moving bak to Georgia where I played football at Greater Atlanta Christian School in Nocross,GA. 
	My efforts in high school earned me scholarship opportunities to colleges and universities in the country which allowed me to further my career in football at The University of Maine.
