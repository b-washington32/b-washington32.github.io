	The city of Atlanta is my favorite city in the entire world!
	After just crossing the 1 million people milestone, metro Atlanta has been listed as the 9th largest metropolitan statistical area in the country with 5.7 million people. 
	There is a ton of stuff to do in my hometown, from seeing fish at what is now the #1 aquarium in the world, The Georgia Aquarium. 
	Also, if you're a soda lover, you could visit the World of Coca-Cola and taste Coke from all over the world!
	Atlanta is also a historic place where you can visit the Martin Luther King Nation Historic site or Jimmy Carter Library and Museum.
	You can also get a taste of history i sports because Atlanta is home of the 1996 Olympics and Super Bowl.
	Atlanta is a hot bed for music where past artist such Outkast, T.I. and Gucci Mane reside. Also it is home to major recording records such as Def Jam, Grand Hustle Records and So So Daf Records.
